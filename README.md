# ETH2me

Simple app to showcase a widget to recieve ETH donations on your website.

Used [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) for interacting with Ethereum serving as a provider.

User will need to have the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download) browser extension installed

You will need to enter your own address to receive funds.

It's fetching the current ETH price in realtime from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) 's API.

Feel free to use and modify it to suit your needs üê∏
